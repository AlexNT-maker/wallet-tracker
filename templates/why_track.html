        <h1 class="slide-left delay-1"> Why to track your money moves?</h1>
        <p class="slide-left delay-2"> How many times have you forgotten your small expenses?
If you're anything like me — most of them.
Have you ever wondered how much you'd save by just setting aside $3 a day?
That’s $1,080 per year.
You could invest it. You could travel.
But first — you have to see it.  </p>

<h2 class="slide-left delay-3"> Awareness is power </h2>   

<p class="slide-left delay-4"> Tracking your money is the first step to financial awareness.
It helps you understand where your money goes, identify spending patterns, and make informed decisions.
It’s not about restriction; it’s about empowerment.</p>

<h2 class="slide-left delay-5"> You can't improve what you don't measure</h2>

<p class="slide-left delay-6"> Just like in fitness, tracking your finances allows you to see progress.
You can set goals, monitor your spending, and celebrate your achievements.
Tracking your money is like having a financial fitness tracker.</p>

<h2 class="slide-left delay-7"> Daily Habits → Long-Term Control</h2>

<p class="slide-left delay-8"> Small daily habits lead to long-term financial control.
Tracking your expenses every day builds awareness and discipline.
Over time, it becomes second nature — and that’s when real change starts.
It’s not about being perfect; it’s about consistency.</p>
